# edX-coding-quiz-challenge
This project is the result of this weeks module, We have been working throughout the week with javascript powered api's.

## What was your motivation?
My motivation for the project is to achieve the course objectives and actively use the skills that I have learnt within lesson.

## Why did you build this project? 
I built this project to use my current understanding of event object listeners and to utilize this accordingly so that I can take the real world knowledge and apply it with greater efficiency.

## What problem does it solve?
This project serves to solve two different problems the first of which would be that it makes use of my current knowledge within the javascript language and the second would be for the potential users of the app on its completion as it will be a resource to help potential users with their accuracy to details and learnt information.
